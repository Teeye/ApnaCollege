                     commonly referred to as simply The Avengers) is a 2012 
                     American superhero film based on the Marvel Comics 
                     superhero team of the same name. Produced by Marvel 
                     Studios and distributed by Walt Disney Studios Motion
                      Pictures,[a] it is the sixth film in the Marvel

                             film's development began when Marvel Studios received 
                             a loan from Merrill Lynch in April 2005. After the 
                             success of the film Iron Man in May 2008, Marvel
                              announced that The Avengers would be released in 
                              July 2011 and would bring together Stark (Downey),
                               Rogers (Evans), Banner (at the time portrayed by 
                               Edward Norton),[b] and Thor (Hemsworth) from Marvel's
                                previous films. With the signing of Johansson as 
                                Romanoff in March 2009, Renner as Barton in June
                                 2010, and Ruffalo replacing Norton as Banner 
                                 in July 2010, the film was pushed back for a 2012 
                                 release. Whedon was brought on board in April 2010
                                  and rewrote the original screenplay by Zak Penn. 
                                  Production began in April 2011 in Albuquerque, 
                                  New Mexico, before moving to Cleveland, Ohio in
